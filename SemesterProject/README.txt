1. Navigate to location of Flask app.

2. In your Command Line Interface, for Windows type "set FLASK_APP=app.py" and hit enter. 
        *(I'm not familiar with iOS commands)*

3. Then type "flask run". When the server is booted up you will see an IP address "127.0.0.1". 
    Depending on your terminal you can click that IP address, or copy and paste it into your browser of choice.

4. Website should be loaded and you can explore as you need.
