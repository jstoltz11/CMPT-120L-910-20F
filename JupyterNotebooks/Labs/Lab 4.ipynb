    "After reading the instruction and looking at the code for a little, my first thought was of defining a couple of additional functions for use in our main function. I spent some time trying to figure out what variables or modifiers to use in these other functions. Upon further contemplation I realized the whole thing boiled down to applying stipulations to items in a list. This led me to develop a 'for' loop and apply the instructions based on the positive or negative values."
